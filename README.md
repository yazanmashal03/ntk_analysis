# Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) behavior in both finite and infinite width regimes, with a focus on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This project was completed for the course **WI4450: Special Topics in Computational Science and Engineering (2024/2025 Q3‚ÄìQ4)**.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project investigates the scaling properties of Neural Tangent Kernels in finite-width and finite-depth neural networks, inspired by the paper ["Finite Depth and Width Corrections to the Neural Tangent Kernel"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05989). The research explores:

- **NTK scaling behavior** with respect to network depth and width
- **Activation function effects** on NTK properties (ReLU, GELU, Sigmoid)
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** in both infinite and finite width regimes
- **Training dynamics** and convergence properties
