# Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis for PDE Solving: A Numerical Investigation

## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) behavior in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on the Poisson equation. The study will investigate the scaling properties of NTK with respect to both network depth and width, while exploring practical implications for neural network architecture design.

## Research Objectives

1. **NTK Scaling Analysis**
   - Investigate the asymptotic behavior of NTK with respect to network depth and width
   - Validate theoretical predictions regarding NTK scaling laws
   - Analyze the relationship between depth (d) and width (n) ratio (d/n)

2. **Architecture Optimization**
   - Determine optimal d/n ratios for different problem complexities
   - Evaluate the "rule of thumb" d/n << 1 suggested in literature
   - Study the impact of different activation functions on NTK behavior

3. **Data-Dependent Analysis**
   - Investigate Boris Hanin's conjectures regarding data-dependent aspects of NTK
   - Analyze how input data distribution affects NTK properties
   - Study the relationship between NTK behavior and generalization performance

## Methodology

1. **Numerical Implementation**
   - Implement a neural network solver for the Poisson equation
   - Develop tools for computing and analyzing NTK matrices
   - Create visualization tools for NTK spectrum analysis

2. **Experimental Framework**
   - Conduct systematic experiments varying network depth and width
   - Test different activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, etc.)
   - Analyze NTK behavior across different problem domains

3. **Analysis Tools**
   - Develop metrics for quantifying NTK properties
   - Implement statistical analysis of NTK spectrum
   - Create visualization tools for NTK evolution during training
